# Stick Knights Online
Client source code for Stick Knights Online, an online side scrolling stickman
role playing game.

## Development Status
The codebase is currently undergoing heavy re-factoring in order to make it
easier to expand and improve the game, as well making it more approachable to
anybody who would wish to collaborate.

## Compiling
SDL must be downloaded and installed seperately. Support for doing so can be
found on the SDL website.

1. Copy contents of operating_system.<OS>.h into operating_system.h
..* Example: copy contents of operating_system.linux.h into operating_system.h
    if on Ubuntu or another Linux distro.

2. Copy contents of Makefile.<OS> into Makefile
..* Example: copy contents of operating_system.linux.h into operating_system.h
    if on Ubuntu or another Linux distro.

More thorough/in-depth compile guidelines are planned.
